# I and M
To begin, we asume that you already have knowledge in machine leaning using R. If that is the case clone this repository. Otherwise, consider reading the book from max kuhn (here)[https://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html].

After cloning the repository open your terminal/shell and cd into the folder containing the repository.
Type the following line in the terminal
git checkout develop

This should list the following files and directory.
1. A folder called dataset
2. A file called mycode.R
3. The rest of the files are not important for now.

Using Rstudio, R GUI (The r graphical user interface), or your favorite IDE open the file called 
mycode.R.
Set the working directory to the directory containing the cloned repository by editing the first
line in the mycode.R. file i.e. edit the line `setwd("E:/projects/I and M bank")` to reflect your current
working directory.
